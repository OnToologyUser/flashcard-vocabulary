# Flash card vocabulary

This is a specification/vocabulary for flash cards. Flash cards are used by students in classroom drills or in private study to improve memorization. A flash card contains information such as words, numbers or images and is divided into a test and a related answer. Multiple cards belong to a stack e.g. vocabulary cards for a chapter in a foreign language textbook.
